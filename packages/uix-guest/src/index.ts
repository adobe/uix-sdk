/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 * Tools for UI Extensions meant to run inside extensible apps. Connects
 * Extensions running in their own window contexts with the host app, allowing
 * the host and guest to exchange method, events, and signals.
 *
 * @remarks The core object of this library, which extensions use for
 * communication, is the Guest object. There are two variants of the Guest
 * object {@link GuestServer} for the bootstrap frame which your extension keeps
 * running in the background, and {@link GuestUI} for frames meant to be
 * displayed in the host application. An extension must have one GuestServer
 * frame, and the host app may choose to use one or more GuestUI frames.
 *
 * @example Creating and connecting a GuestServer with {@link register}
 * ```typescript
 * import { register } from "@adobe/uix-guest";
 *
 * const server = await register({
 *   // Must match extension ID from registry
 *   id: "My Custom View Extension",
 *   // enable logging in dev build
 *   debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production",
 *   // Host can access these methods from its Port to this guest
 *   methods: {
 *     // Methods must be namespaced by one or more levels
 *     myCustomView: {
 *       async documentIsViewable(docId) {
 *         const doc = await callMyRuntimeAction(docId);
 *         return someValidation(doc);
 *       },
 *       renderView(docId, depth) {
 *         // Use a host method
 *         const tooltip = await server.host.editor.requestTooltip({
 *           type: 'frame',
 *           url: new URL(`/show/${docId}`, location).href
 *         })
 *       }
 *     },
 *   },
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @example Connecting to an existing GuestServer with a GuestUI
 * ```typescript
 * import { attach } from "@adobe/uix-guest";
 *
 * const ui = await attach({
 *   id: "My Custom View Extension",
 * })
 *
 * // when editing is done:
 * const saved = await ui.host.editor.saveChanges();
 * if (!saved) {
 *   const editorState = ui.sharedContext.get('editorState');
 *   if (editorState.tooltips[ui.id].invalid === true) {
 *     putGuestUIInInvalidState();
 *   }
 * } else {
 *   ui.host.editor.dismissTooltip();
 * }
 * ```
