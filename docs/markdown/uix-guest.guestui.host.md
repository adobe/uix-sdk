## GuestUI.host property

Proxy object for calling methods on the host.

**Signature:**

```typescript
host: RemoteHostApis<IHost>;
```

## Remarks

Any APIs exposed to the extension via [Port.provide()](./uix-host.port.provide.md) can be called on this object. Because these methods are called with RPC, they are all asynchronous, The return types of all Host methods will be Promises which resolve to the value the Host method returns.
