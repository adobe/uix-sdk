## CrossRealmObject interface

> This API is provided as an alpha preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

Representation of an object on the other side of an iframe/window divide between JS runtimes.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface CrossRealmObject<ExpectedApi> 
```

## Remarks

At first, xrobject simply returned the proxy to the remote object and did not expose any of the underlying event handling. However, there was no way for a consumer to handle the case where the remote iframe reloaded, which would invalidate all of the simulated objects.

This new manager object exposes the [Tunnel](./uix-core.tunnel.md) object so that consumers can subscribe to the "api" event.
