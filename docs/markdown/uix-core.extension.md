## Extension interface

/\*\* An individual UI extension retrieved from the registry.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export interface Extension 
```

## Remarks

This interface is likely to expand. As the metadata from the extension registry stabilizes, it should probably be passed through. Right now, there are too many cases where an extension string ID is directly used; this should probably be an opaque, structured object.

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [id](./uix-core.extension.id.md) |  | string | Unique ID of the extension. Must be unique across entire app |
|  [url](./uix-core.extension.url.md) |  | string | Location of the document to load for the [GuestServer](./uix-guest.guestserver.md) |
