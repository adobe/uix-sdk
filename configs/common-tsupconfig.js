 * TODO reenable build minification and optimization.
 * Removed 2022-09-28 to improve debugging experience for extension devs.
 *
 * The following is the output of `node scripts/bundler.mjs report`.
 *
 * Current bundle size reports in development mode:
 *   require('@adobe/uix-core') ← 8.36kb
 *   require('@adobe/uix-guest') ← 16.74kb including core
 *   require('@adobe/uix-host') ← 25.58kb including core
 *   require('@adobe/uix-host-react') ← 38.18kb including host
 *
 * When production mode is enabled in the current state, the bundle sizes are:
 *   require('@adobe/uix-core') ← 4.04kb
 *   require('@adobe/uix-guest') ← 7.07kb including core
 *   require('@adobe/uix-host') ← 11.80kb including core
 *   require('@adobe/uix-host-react') ← 16.10kb including host
 *
 * As of now, the final size of this dependency is fairly small compared to the
 * overall weight of the bundles that consume it. Still, disabling optimization
 * does double the size, which may become a concern as features are added.
